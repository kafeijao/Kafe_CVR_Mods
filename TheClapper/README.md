This mod allows to hide/show **avatars** and **props** by clapping their head. Similarly how the cvr camera works. You
can restore the avatars by clapping the kyle's head. As for props, once you clap them they are gone. When you clap props
that you spawned, it will delete for everyone.

## Configuration

- **PreventClappingFriendAvatars**: Whether or not to ignore friend's avatars when clapping.
- **ShowVisualizersAfterOpenHands**: Whether or not to show visualizers of where to clap. The visualizers appear 1 second
after having both hands with the open hand gesture.
