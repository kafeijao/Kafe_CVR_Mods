Mod suggested by [AstroDoge](https://github.com/AstroDogeDX)

This mod will replace the toggle between hand animations and index finger tracking, with gesture lock/unlock (while
finger tracking being always on).

This mod is only meant to be used with the `index controllers` only. It won't affect other setups.

This mod will:

- Force the index finger tracking to be enabled **all** the time!
- Toggle gesture lock when pressing the button used for toggling index finger tracking.
- Make the setting `ControlEnableGesturesWhileFingerTracking` useless.
- Add a melon loader config to enable a notification when you toggle the gestures (disabled by default)
