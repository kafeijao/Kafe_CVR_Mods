  "description": "The Request Lib is a Mod that allows users to receive requests from other players in the same instance via the Mod Network.\n\nThis will enable mods to ask permission for things to players without both having a specific mod. For example if both players have the **RequestLib**, this will allow the `Player 1` with the **TeleportRequest** mod to request to teleport to `Player 2` even if the `Player 2` doesn't have the **TeleportRequest** mod.\n\n__**Features**__\n- Receive requests from remote players via the Mod Network.\n- Similarly to invites, you receive:\n - Hud message icon\n - Quick Menu notification with `Accept`/`Decline`\n - Main Menu Messages Tab named `Mod Requests`\n- Fully customizable permissions that allow requests to be asked, auto-accepted, or auto-declined\n- Several permissions granularity, they can be global, per player, and even per player + mod combo.\n\nCheck [README.md](https://github.com/kafeijao/Kafe_CVR_Mods/tree/master/RequestLib) for more in-depth info including the `API` to add this to your mods.\n\n",
