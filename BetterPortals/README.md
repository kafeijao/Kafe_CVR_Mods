## Retired ⚠️

#### This mod has been retired because it was implemented into the game as a native feature.

Simple mod that improves portal's usability.

### Features
- Added `Drop Portal` button on user's details page
- Portals always drop (as long the world allows portals)
- Added a timer with the seconds left until the portal closes
- Added joining portals by getting on top of it (distance configurable)
- Added requiring an input (`J` or `Trigger` press) to enter a portal
- Get a notification an invisible portal was dropped (on top of you)
