This mod allows to override a few settings for all the pickups in the scene.

## Auto-Hold

Whether the pickups will stick to your hand or not.

With Auto-Hold set to `true` all pickups will stick to your hand once you grab them. To release you need to:

- Press `G` on your keyboard (if playing in desktop)
- Hold the `grip` while pulling the `thumbstick down` on your **right** controller (if playing in VR).

If the Auto-Hold is set to `false` the pickup will be released as soon as you stop holding it.

## Maximum Held Distance

This is how far the pickup can be from your hand. It's useful in VR to set a closer distance (like 0.5 for example)
because when you grab an object it will be brought close to your hand (instead of forcing us to do that weird gymnastics
to bring it closer).

## Maximum Grab Distance

Sets the max distance you can actually grab a pickup. This is useful if you're tired of grabbing random pickups from
across the world. Note: The pickups will still highlight meaning they can be tele-grabbed (the alyx style pull), but you
won't be able to grab unless it is within the max distance

## Configuration

You have always two menu settings per override, the first one says whether it should override or not  the value (if it's
false it will revert to the pickup's default value), the second one is the value you want to set. You can edit the
configs in-game without any issues as it updates for all existing props in the scene.",

You can use the `UI Expansion Kit` (very recommended), or by editing the the config config file located at
`<game_folder>\UserData\MelonPreferences.cfg`. You can change the configs while the game and it will take effect as soon
as you save the config file.
