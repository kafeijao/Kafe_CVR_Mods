  "description": "Allows to override a few settings for all the pickups in the scene.\n\n__**Auto-Hold**__ whether the pickups will stick to your hand or not, to drop a Auto-Held pickup you need to squeeze the right grip and pull the thumbstick back (both on the **right** controller even if the pickup is held on the left controller)\n\n__**Maximum Held Distance**__ this is how far the pickup can be from your hand. It's useful in VR to set a closer distance (like 0.5 for example) because when you grab an object it will be brought close to your hand (instead of forcing us to do that weird gymnastics to bring it closer).\n\n__**Maximum Grab Distance**__ sets the max distance you can actually grab a pickup. This is useful if you're tired of grabbing random pickups from across the world. Note: The pickups will still highlight meaning they can be tele-grabbed (the alyx style pull), but you won't be able to grab unless it is within the max distance.\n\nCheck [README.md](https://github.com/kafeijao/Kafe_CVR_Mods/tree/master/PickupOverrides) for more in-depth info.\n\n",
