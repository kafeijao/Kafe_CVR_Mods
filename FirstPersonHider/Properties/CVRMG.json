  "description": "This mod enables hiding avatar game objects in the first person view. You will need to add the tag `[FPH]` to a game object name (Eg: `HairRoot[FPH]69`), it will **also** hide its children game objects.\n\nIs uses the same mechanism as the head shrinking, so hidden game objects will still be visible for mirrors and cameras.\n\nYou can customize the tags to hide in the config. \nHas to be via `MelonPreferences.cfg`\n\nYou can exclude single game objects from being hidden with the tag `[FPR]`, this is implemented in the base game and doesn't need the mod to work (you can use this to reveal your hair in first person that's hidden by the head shrink for example).\n\nCheck [README.md](https://github.com/kafeijao/Kafe_CVR_Mods/tree/master/FirstPersonHider) for more info.\n\n",
